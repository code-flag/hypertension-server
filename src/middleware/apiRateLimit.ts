 * function into the array. The .set() function provided by node-cache takes three arguments: key, value

 *  IPCache variable. If the IP address already exists in the cache, you will use the existing TTL; else, 
 * you will set TTL as TIME_FRAME_IN_S.
 * The TTL for the current key-value pair is calculated by subtracting the present timestamp from the expiry 
 * timestamp. The difference is then converted to seconds and passed as the third argument to the .set() 
 * function. The .getTtl() function takes a key and IP address as an argument and returns the TTL of the
